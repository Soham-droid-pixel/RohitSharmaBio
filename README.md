It features:

* A short introduction and biography of Rohit Sharma
* Embedded image and external fonts for better styling
* Clean and readable structure
* Deployed and live via **GitHub Pages**

## 💭 Looking Back...

Building this project was a **milestone moment** for me. I still remember:

* Writing my first `<h1>` tag
* Figuring out how to use `<div>` to organize content
* Experimenting with `color: yellow;` to make that heading pop
* Copy-pasting my first image URL and seeing it appear like magic
* That feeling when I typed `git push` and saw the site go live 💫

This wasn’t just code — it was the beginning of something exciting.

## 🔮 What I Gained

* Confidence to build something from scratch
* A deeper appreciation for clean code and design
* The thrill of deploying something online for the world to see
* The motivation to keep learning and never stop creating 💻🚀
